# Arduino project with ESP8266, RFID and temperature modules, MQTT, WiFi, SQL

This project was created for university classes. It's supposed to use RFID and temperature modules connected to ESP8266 board. The board connects to WiFi and communicates over MQTT network protocol sending info about scanned RFID tags together with temperature values. Data is processed in Windows Forms app and sent to logs inside of app window together with SQL queries to the local database.

## Modules
- ESP8266,
- RFID reader,
- temperature sensor.
